# Authenticator

This plugin allows you to make your WordPress site accessible to logged in users only.

## Description
This plugin allows you to make your WordPress site accessible to logged in users only. In other words to view your site they have to create / have an account in your site and be logged in. No configuration necessary, simply activating - thats all.

### Made by [Inpsyde](http://inpsyde.com) &middot; We love WordPress
Have a look at the premium plugins in our [market](http://marketpress.com).

## Installation
### Requirements
* WordPress version 1.5 and later; current (01/2012) tested with 3.3* and 3.4-alpha
* PHP 5.2*

On PHP-CGI setups:

* `mod_setenvif` or `mod_rewrite` (if you want to user HTTP-Authentication for feeds)

### Installation
1. Unpack the download-package
2. Upload folder include the file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
3. Activate the plugin through the `Plugins` menu in WordPress

or use the installer via backend of WordPress

### On PHP-CGI setups
If you want to use HTTP-Authentication for feeds (available since 1.1.0 as a *optional* feature) you have to update your `.htaccess` file. If [mod_setenvif](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_setenvif.html) is available, add the following line to your `.htaccess`:

```
SetEnvIfNoCase ^Authorization$ "(.+)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
```

Otherwise you need [mod_rewrite](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/mod/mod_rewrite.html) to be enabled. In this case you have to add the following line to your `.htaccess`:

```
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
```

In a typical Wordpress .htaccess it all looks like:

```
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
</IfModule>
```

respectively in a multisite installation:

```
# BEGIN WordPress
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L]

# uploaded files
RewriteRule ^files/(.+) wp-includes/ms-files.php?file=$1 [L]

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -f [OR]
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} -d
RewriteRule ^ - [L]

RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
RewriteRule . index.php [L]
# END WordPress
```
## Settings
You can change the settings of Authenticator on Options → Reading. The settings refer to the behaviour of your blog's feeds. Should they be protected by HTTP-Authentication (not all Feed-Readers support this) or by an authentication token, which is simply add to your feed URL as Parameter. The third option is to keep everything in place. So Feed-URLs will be redirected to the login page if the user is not logged in (send no auth-cookie). 

If you using token authentication, you can show the token to the blog users on their profile settings page by setting these option.

### HTTP Auth
Users can gain access to the feed with their Username/Password. 

### Token Auth
The plugin will generate a token automaticaly, when choosing this option. Copy this token and share it with the people who should have access to your feed. If your token is `ef05aa961a0c10dce006284213727730` the feed-URLs looks like so:
```php
# main feed
http://yourblog.com/feed/?ef05aa961a0c10dce006284213727730

#main comment feed 
http://yourblog.com/comments/feed/?ef05aa961a0c10dce006284213727730

#without permalinks
http://yourblog.com/?feed=rss2&ef05aa961a0c10dce006284213727730
```
